### Equilibrium MD Simulations
Three systems were simulated, each consisting of a POPC lipid bilayer with S₈ molecules, GSH molecules, or both. 
Simulations were run to study the behavior and interactions of S₈ and GSH in the bilayer, including their positioning and orientation. 

### Potential of Mean Force (PMF)
PMFs for S₈ and GSH were calculated using umbrella sampling MD simulations to identify favorable positions across the lipid bilayer.
